# codecore-drills-react
CodeCore Group Project: CodeCore Drillz, a coding quiz app built using Node, Express, and React.js

This is a single page application that uses React.js on the front end, which interacts with the Node.js 
backend via RESTful API calls. The React and Node projects are separate and run independently, and both
of them are in this git repository.
